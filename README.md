Unofficial Ultimate Guitar .com Chrome extension
Frustrated that the autoscroll of ultime guitar .com didn't work consistently on my different browsers and curious to experiment with Chrome extensions 
I decided to start this little experiment. 
I didn't plan on sharing it but because it seems that I'm not the only one facing this issue (see: https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1774374),
here is the code of my little experiment.  
Don't hesitate to improve it, I'm not proud of it, at this stage it's more of a hack/POC.

## To Install:
Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.
Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.
